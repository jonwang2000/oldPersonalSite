# PersonalSite

Personal website, meant to be a clean and simplistic site. Built without any frameworks, just CSS Flexbox and Grid.

### Currently Working On:
* About page, probably education/current status
* Projects page

### TODO:

* Whitespace and padding/margins between elements (design)
* Blog?
* Clean up spacing and code
* Responsive design for mobile/small windows
